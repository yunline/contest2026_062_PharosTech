/****************************************************************************
 * SINGLE-INSTANCE (singleton) contract
 *
 * This module is explicitly a single-instance design.  The per-screen
 * full-frame double buffers are statically allocated (g_nyabula_fb in
 * nyabula_dual_lcd.c) so their base addresses are 64B-aligned and in low
 * 32-bit memory, enabling DMA-direct whole-frame writes to the QSPI FSPI
 * lower-half without a bounce buffer.  A static buffer is inherently
 * unique process-wide, so only ONE nyabula_dual_lcd_create() may be
 * outstanding at a time.
 *
 * Consequence:
 *   - Calling nyabula_dual_lcd_create() while an instance already exists
 *     (and has not been destroyed) FAILS and returns NULL.
 *   - After nyabula_dual_lcd_destroy(), a new instance may be created
 *     again (the static buffers are reused by the new instance).
 *
 * If a true multi-instance design were ever required, the static buffers
 * would have to be moved to per-instance dynamic allocation, which would
 * sacrifice the DMA-direct property (dynamic heap only guarantees 8B
 * alignment / arbitrary placement) -- a deliberate trade-off this module
 * does not make.

 *      array is also physically 64B-aligned for the DMA engine.
 *   2) The .bss (and hence this array) links below 4 GiB, inside the DMA
 *      engine's 32-bit SAR/DAR addressable range.
 * If either is violated the buffers fall back to the lower-half's bounce /
 * polling path and the DMA-direct benefit is lost (correctness is NOT
