/****************************************************************************
 * RK3576 MIPI DSI-2 host controller driver public interface.
 *
 * Implements the NuttX generic MIPI DSI framework (struct mipi_dsi_host /
 * struct mipi_dsi_host_ops) on top of the RK3576 DSI-2 controller.  The
 * board layer calls rk3576_mipi_dsi_initialize() to obtain the host, then
 * optionally registers it with mipi_dsi_host_register() so that LCD panel
 * drivers can bind to it via mipi_dsi_device.
 *
 * The DSI driver owns the whole link lifecycle, including the DCPHY: board
 * code never talks to the PHY directly.  rk3576_mipi_dsi_initialize()
 * brings up the DCPHY and enters Command mode, so the panel DCS init
 * sequence can be transmitted over the (live) D-PHY lanes immediately.
 * rk3576_mipi_dsi_enable_video() then programs the IPI (Image Pixel
 * Interface) timing and transitions the host to Video mode, where pixel
 * data from the VOP is streamed to the panel.
 *
 * Command-mode transfer (DCS init / generic read-write) is handled through
 * the DSI-2 Command Interface (CRI) register bank and is usable in both
 * Command and Video operating states.
 *
 * The VOP (video processor) that feeds the IPI is outside the scope of
 * this driver and is wired up by a separate framebuffer/VOP driver.

 * Name: rk3576_mipi_dsi_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize the RK3576 DSI-2 host controller and return the host to be

 *
 *   The RK3576 has a single DSI-2 host, so the driver is a singleton.
 *   The DCPHY must have been initialized beforehand (rk3576_dcphy_init()).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   config - Link/PHY configuration (lanes, format, video mode, hs_rate).
 *            Must not be NULL.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   A non-NULL struct mipi_dsi_host * on success; NULL on failure.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: rk3576_mipi_dsi_update_pixel_clock
 *
 * Description:
 *   Re-derive the IPI horizontal timing (HSA/HBP/HACT/HLINE) and
 *   PHY_IPI_RATIO from the VOP's REAL pixel clock, once the CRU divider
 *   chain has settled.
 *
 *   The board passes a pixel clock to enable_video(), but the CRU can only
 *   select an integer divider from the parent PLL, and the divider search
 *   picks the largest divisor whose output is still <= the request.  So the
 *   achieved dclk_vp0 can be several percent BELOW the request, and then the
 *   IPI horizontal timing and PHY_IPI_RATIO are computed against a clock the
 *   pixel stream never runs at (the controller would judge "one line ended"
 *   at the wrong instant and mis-size its CDC ratio).
 *
 *   The board therefore requests a value the CRU hits EXACTLY (see
 *   KICKPI_K7_MIPI_DSI_PIXCLK), and rk3576_vop_enable_clocks() logs a
 *   warning if the achieved rate still differs from the request.  This
 *   function remains the escape hatch for the case where an exact request is
 *   impossible.
 *
 *   NOT called from rk3576_vop_enable_clocks() any more: doing so rewrote the
 *   horizontal timing and the CDC ratio of the pixel datapath asynchronously
 *   WHILE the stream was live, which is a race (see the long note in that
 *   function).  If it must be called, call it before the host enters Video
 *   mode.
 *
 *   Safe to call at any time once the host is in Video mode: the IPI timing
 *   registers are plain RW in manual mode and take effect without leaving
 *   Video mode.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pixel_clock_hz - Actual VOP pixel clock (crtc clock) in Hz.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; -EPERM if the host is not in Video mode; -EINVAL on a
 *   bad clock or timing overflow.
