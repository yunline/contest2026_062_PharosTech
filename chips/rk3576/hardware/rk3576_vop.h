/****************************************************************************
 * RK3576 Video Output Processor (VOP) hardware register definitions.
 *
 * Reference: Rockchip RK3576 TRM, Part 2, Chapter 11 "VOP_LITE".
 *
 * The RK3576 VOP is a 3-video-port + 3-POST display processor.  Pixel data
 * is fetched from DDR through the CLUSTER (layers), composed in the
 * OVERLAY blocks, timed by the POST blocks, and finally routed to one of
 * the physical output interfaces (MIPI DSI / HDMI / eDP / DP / RGB) through
 * the per-interface SYS_CTRL_*_INFACE_CTRL mux registers.
 *
 * This minimal driver uses only CLUSTER0_WIN0 (single RGB layer), one
 * video port (PORT0/1/2 -> POST0/1/2) and one output interface.  No MMU,
 * no ESMART, no compression, no blending - the bare minimum to scan out a
 * single 24-bit RGB framebuffer.
 *
 * All register offsets below are relative to RK3576_VOP_ADDR = 0x27D00000.

 *   RK3572 and up  -> bit0 of the video port's own POSTx_CFG_DONE

 * RK3572_VP0_POST_CFG_DONE offset), with a hiword write-enable, so the word to
 * write is 0x00010001 and NOT 0x00000001.  Note what is ABSENT from the
 * RK3572+ sequence: it does not write SYS_WIN_REG_CFG_DONE (0x000C) at all --
 * and that is the only load trigger this driver has ever used for the layer
 * group.  On this generation the 0x000C register looks like a legacy one: it
 * is writable and its bits are consumed at a frame boundary, which is exactly
 * what made it look like a working load request, but the RK3572+ frame commit
 * does not use it.
 *
 * It fits the evidence better than anything else tested: every ESMART
 * register reads back in the MIRROR exactly as programmed, yet changing
 * anything inside the ESMART block changes nothing on screen while changing
 * the SYS block does -- and POST_BUF_EMPTY sets only with the layer routed on.
 * A window whose configuration never leaves the mirror is routed by the mixer
 * (so it visibly displaces the background) but never fetches.
 *
 * VP1/VP2 follow at 0x0DFC/0x0EFC by the POST1/POST2 block stride; this board

 *   [14:0]   calc_dclk_cnt   RO  the count number of dclk over the same window
 *
 * So setting calc_clk_en makes the hardware count aclk and dclk cycles during
 * a FIXED 5000-hclk window and latch both, which turns "is the datapath clock
 * alive?" from an inference into a reading.  The ratio aclk/dclk is directly
 * comparable because both are counted over the same window, and dclk is a
 * built-in control: the POST's timing generator demonstrably runs (forced
 * black, forced zero and the solid background all reach the glass), so dclk
 * MUST count. If dclk counts and aclk does not, the datapath clock is stopped
 * -- which is the long-standing hypothesis in this file:
 *
 *   "the register file sits on the peripheral clock, so it answers reads and
 *    retains writes while the datapath's aclk is gated off; the request
 *    generator then simply never runs, and a clock that is gated produces no
 *    error because nothing happens."
 *
 * It fits every stubborn observation at once: every register reads back
 * correct (hclk/pclk alive), no bus error and no MMU fault are possible (no
 * read is ever issued), and the POST's input buffer under-runs the moment the
 * layer is enabled (the mixer waits forever for data that cannot arrive).
 *
 * The RK3576 video port exposes these as calc_clk_en / calc_aclk_cnt /
 * calc_dclk_cnt, confirming the field layout.

 * dma_stop_validN IS A STATUS, NOT A CONTROL.  This driver has only ever
 * looked at the dma_stop bit inside SYS_AXI0_CTRL_IMD -- the bit it WRITES --
 * and a status field exists precisely because what the channel is actually
 * doing can differ from what the control register holds.  A channel that
 * really is stopped cannot issue a read, and a stopped channel raises no
 * error: that is exactly this board's signature -- the window configured
 * correctly, the mixer visibly waiting for it (the POST under-runs the moment
 * the layer is enabled), and yet no read, no bus error and no MMU fault.
 *
 * (The TRM's field names and bit numbers come out in separate blocks for this
 * register; the two remaining bits after [28:16] and [15:2] are 1 and 0, and

 *
 * A probe stepped this register through five colours and the screen was asked
 * to repeat the order back.  It wrote, in order, 0x3ff into the field named
 * red, then into the field named green, then blue, white, black; the screen
 * showed RED, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE, BLACK.  So on this hardware:
 *
 *     0x3ff at bits[29:20]  ->  RED    on the glass
 *     0x3ff at bits[19:10]  ->  GREEN  on the glass
 *     0x3ff at bits[ 9:0]   ->  BLUE   on the glass
 *
 * i.e. the plain RGB order, and a value written through the BLUE field appears
 * green while one written through the GREEN field appears blue.  Either the
 * TRM's field naming for this register is the other way round, or something
 * downstream exchanges green and blue; the observation cannot tell the two
 * apart, and for the purpose of controlling the screen it does not need to.
 * What matters is that the mapping above is the one that produces the intended
 * colour, and it is the one encoded here.
 *
 * (Worth noting for later, since it cannot be distinguished yet: if the
 * exchange is downstream of the mixer rather than a register naming quirk,
 * then the LAYER's colours are exchanged too and a framebuffer will show blue
 * where it should show green.  That is a colour error, not a cause of garbage,
 * so it is recorded and set aside.)
 *
 * THE LESSON: a probe that drove this register with the TRIED-AND-WRONG value
 * reported "blue" and that report was believed for a whole round, which is
 * what prompted swapping these two macros in the first place.  The colour
 * actually programmed at the time was green.  A marker whose colour is not

 *   Esmart3 : axi_id 1 (axi1)  yrgb 0x0c  uv 0x0d
 *
 * The reset values read 0x0a/0x0b, which is Esmart2's pair -- and Esmart2
 * fetches on axi1, while Esmart0 fetches on axi0.  So by leaving this register
 * untouched, the window was issuing reads that declared themselves as a
 * different window on a different AXI port.  The ID travels with the read all
 * the way into the interconnect, where it decides routing and QoS, and the
 * failure mode of a bogus ID is a read that never comes back -- no data, no
 * bus error, and a POST whose output buffer is permanently empty.  That is
 * precisely this board's signature.
