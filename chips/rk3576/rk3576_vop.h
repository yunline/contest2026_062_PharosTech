/****************************************************************************
 * RK3576 Video Output Processor (VOP) framebuffer driver public interface.
 *
 * Wraps the NuttX generic framebuffer framework (struct fb_vtable_s) on top
 * of the RK3576 VOP.  rk3576_vop_initialize() allocates the framebuffer
 * (via the DMA heap), programs one WIN0 layer + one video port + one output
 * interface, then self-registers the framebuffer as /dev/fbN.
 *
 * The VOP is shared by multiple physical output interfaces (MIPI DSI,
 * HDMI, eDP, DP, RGB).  Routing is expressed as an (interface, port) pair
 * so that the driver is interface-agnostic and extensible: adding a new
 * output only requires a new RK3576_VOP_IFACE_* entry and a matching
 * interface-ctrl register offset in the internal map.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: rk3576_vop_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize the RK3576 VOP, allocate the framebuffer, program a single
 *   WIN0 RGB888 layer routed through the requested video port to the
 *   requested output interface, and self-register the framebuffer as
 *   /dev/fbN (N = config->display).
 *
 *   The framebuffer is allocated from the RK3576 DMA heap
 *   (rk3576_dma_alloc) because the VOP WIN0 YRGB_MST register is a 32-bit
 *   physical address (MMU bypass), therefore the buffer must be physically
 *   contiguous and below 4GB.
 *
 *   The caller must have already brought up the output interface (e.g.
 *   rk3576_mipi_dsi_initialize()) and programmed its timing to match
 *   config->xres/yres and the porch/sync timings.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   config - Framebuffer/routing configuration.  Must not be NULL.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success; a negated errno value on failure.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: rk3576_vop_fill
 *
 * Description:
 *   Fill the framebuffer with a single solid colour.
 *
 *   Two uses, both about making a bring-up experiment legible:
 *
 *     - A solid colour is the only pattern whose appearance on the panel is
 *       unambiguous.  The default checkerboard is fine as an "is the source
 *       black?" probe, but a panel that lights up showing OUR colour proves
 *       pixel data traversed the whole path (VOP -> IPI -> PHY -> panel) with
 *       the right content, while stripes or noise proves the packets arrive
 *       but are misparsed.  A checkerboard cannot tell those apart.
 *
 *     - Giving each configuration under test its OWN colour lets a human
 *       observer report which one lit the panel without needing to read the
 *       console for timing: "it showed green" identifies the third entry of
 *       the matrix directly.
 *
 *   It also gets the source out of the way as an explanation for a dark
 *   screen: an all-zero framebuffer would make every one of the above
 *   unanswerable.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   rgb - 0xRRGGBB (the framebuffer is R,G,B byte order, matching RGB888).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK, or -ENODEV if the VOP has not been initialised.

 * Name: rk3576_vop_fill_bands
 *
 * Description:
 *   Paint horizontal bands of solid colour into the framebuffer and clean the
 *   D-cache so the ESMART layer's MMU-bypassed fetch sees them.
 *
 *   The colours are chosen so that a wrong byte order shows up in one look:
 *   red and blue exchange places, and a solid white or black fill could never
 *   reveal it because swapping two equal bytes changes nothing.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   colors - Array of RGB888 values, first band first.
 *   nbands - Number of entries in colors.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success; -ENODEV if no display is up; -EINVAL on a bad
 *   argument.
