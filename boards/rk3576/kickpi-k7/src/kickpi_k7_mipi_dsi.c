/****************************************************************************
 * On-board MIPI DSI LCD panel bring-up for the kickpi-k7 (RK3576).
 *
 * Wiring map (see kickpi-k7-dsi-display.txt):
 *   - DSI data/clock lanes use dedicated pins (no GPIO mux needed).
 *   - LCD_BL_PWM : GPIO0_B5 / PWM1_CH1  (backlight)
 *   - LCD_RST    : GPIO0_A2             (panel reset, active-low)
 *   - LCD_PWREN  : GPIO0_C6             (panel power enable)
 *
 * Panel: WKS50HD072-WCT (5.0", 720 x 1280, DSI video mode).
 *
 * NOTE: this board code supports ONE panel model -- the WKS50HD072-WCT --
 *whose DCS init sequence and video-mode timing are hard-coded below.  A
 *different panel needs its data sheet consulted and the timing / init sequence
 *re-tuned; this is not a drop-in match for arbitrary DSI panels.
 *
 * WKS50HD072-WCT:
 *   - 720 x 1280 portrait, RGB888, 4 data lanes, 62 MHz pixel clock
 *   - Timing (vendor-supplied; identical to the mainline 5" ILI9881D modes
 *     bananapi,lhr050h41 and startek,kd050hdfia020):
 *             HFP=10 HSYNC=20 HBP=30 (htotal=780),
 *             VFP=10 VSYNC=10 VBP=20 (vtotal=1320)  -> ~60 Hz
 *   - 780 and 1320 are both 4-pixel aligned, which the RK3576 DSI-2 TRM 18.2.1
 *     requires for HTOTAL/HACTIVE/HSYNC/HBP/HFP.
 *
 * Bring-up sequence (the chip drivers own the DCPHY, so board code never
 * touches the PHY directly):
 *   1. rk3576_mipi_dsi_initialize()          -- DSI-2 host; brings up the
 *                                               DCPHY and enters Command mode
 *   2. mipi_dsi_host_register / device_register
 *   3. kickpi_k7_mipi_dsi_configure_pins() + panel_bringup()
 *                                            -- power/reset cycle, DCS init
 *                                               sequence, DISPON verification
 *   4. kickpi_k7_mipi_dsi_bist_clear()       -- the panel must not free-run
 *                                               its own test pattern
 *   5. kickpi_k7_video_initialize()         -- register /dev/fbN; the pixel
 *                                               clock must be live BEFORE
 *                                               video mode is entered
 *   6. rk3576_mipi_dsi_enable_video()        -- program IPI timing, then
 *                                               transition to Video mode
 *   7. kickpi_k7_mipi_dsi_backlight_enable() -- backlight on
 *
 * Steps 1-3, 6 and 7 stay here; step 5 is shared with the HDMI path and lives
 * in kickpi_k7_video.c.

/* MADCTL (36h) argument bits.  ILI9881D 5.3.20 defines the byte as
 * "0 0 0 0 BGR 0 SS GS" with a reset default of 00h, so the vendor table's
 * 0x03 sets only SS and GS and leaves BGR = 0.  Unlike a generic MIPI DCS
 * MADCTL there is no MY/MX/MV: D7..D4 are reserved on this panel, so SS and
 * GS are the ONLY orientation controls.
 *
 * BGR (bit3) is NOT asserted, and that is a correction rather than an
 * omission: it used to be, to compensate for ESMART's REGION0_MST_CTL
 * rb_swap (bit14) being wrongly set in rk3576_vop.c.  Those two bits are the
 * two ends of ONE R/B swap, so exactly one may be active -- asserting both
 * cancels out and the inversion returns.  The VOP now leaves its bit clear
 * for an RGB888 framebuffer, which is the correct setting, so the panel must
 * not add its own.
 *
 * Worth recording that the swap was invisible from this file and looked like
 * a panel defect: red and blue came out exchanged on this display for as long
 * as the VOP bit was wrong, and asserting BGR here hid it.  The DSI link could
 * not have revealed it either -- MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB888 names the byte order of
 * the pixel stream (R,G,B) and the DSI-2 host has no colour-order field, so a
 * wrong upstream order passes through untouched.  Only a second sink on the
 * same VOP -- here the HDMI output, which has no MADCTL to compensate with --
 * exposed the real cause.
 *
 * SS and GS are scan-direction bits, not just sequencing flags: SS reverses
 * the source (column) scan order and GS reverses the gate (row) scan order,
 * so each one mirrors one axis of the picture on the glass.  The vendor's
 * 0x03 leaves both set; the board's enclosure mounts the panel the other way
 * up, so both are cleared below, which mirrors both axes and is therefore a
 * 180-degree rotation of the whole picture.  Note that this is a property of
 * the panel alone: it costs no scan-out bandwidth and needs no change to the
 * VOP timing or to the framebuffer geometry.
 *
 * If the result ever comes out mirrored on a single axis instead of rotated,
 * that means the reference orientation was the other one -- set exactly one of
 * the two bits (GS alone or SS alone) to mirror the remaining axis.
